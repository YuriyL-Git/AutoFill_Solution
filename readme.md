Project is created to help the user automatically fill in available data.

To start using the program, simply push the 'Fill' button. General info will be 
filled in, and a worker modal window filled in with available information will be open. 
Fill in missing information for the current worker, push the 'Add' button, and wait 
until current worker information will be saved, and a new modal window will be open. 
The process will continue running until all the available worker's information will be 
saved into the table.

At any moment worker modal window could be closed. After pushing the 'Fill' or 'Add' buttons 
the process will continue from the place it was stopped.
